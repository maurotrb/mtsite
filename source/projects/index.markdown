Reproducible Research Assignment - Project 2
--------------------------------------------
Project of [Reproducible Research course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata), June 2014 edition.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
(NOAA) storm database to answer the following questions:

1. Across the United States, which types of weather events are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Across the United States, which types of weather events have the greatest economic consequences?

The resulting report has been published on [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/maurotrb/20463).

Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment
------------------------------------
Project of [Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata), May 2014 edition.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

[GitHub](https://github.com/maurotrb/getting-cleaning-data-2014-project "getting-cleaning-data-2014-project on github")

Data Analysis and Statistical Inference Assignment
--------------------------------------------------
Project of [Data Analysis and Statistical Inference course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/statistics), February 2014 edition.

The project studies the relationship between the highest degree earned by United
States residents and their family income in constant dollars.

Access to education and its funding is the subject of many discussions on social
mobility and redistribution of income. The study explores data from a long running
social survey to verify one of the main topic of these discussions: if family
income is related to education level.

The study uses [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www3.norc.org/gss+website/)
data for the year 2012.

Data Analysis Assignment - Project 2
------------------------------------
Second assignment of [Data Analysis course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis),
November 2013 edition.

The data for this assignment are the Samsung activity data available from the
[course website](https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/dataanalysis/samsungData.rda).
These data are slightly processed to make them easier to load into R.

You can also find the raw data here:

<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>

The task is to build a function that predicts what activity a subject is performing
based on the quantitative measurements from the Samsung phone. For this analysis
your training set must include the data from subjects 1, 3, 5, and 6.
But you may use more subjects data to train if you wish. Your test set is the data
from subjects 27, 28, 29, and 30, but you may use more data to test. Be careful
that your training/test sets do not overlap.

Data Analysis Assignment - Project 1
------------------------------------
First assignement of [Data Analysis course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis),
November 2013 edition.

The data consist of a sample of 2,500 peer-to-peer loans issued through the
[Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/home.action).
The interest rate of these loans is determined by the Lending Club on the basis
of characteristics of the person asking for the loan such as their employment history,
credit history, and creditworthiness scores.

The purpose of the analysis is to identify and quantify associations between
the interest rate of the loan and the other variables in the data set.
In particular, you should consider whether any of these variables have an important
association with interest rate after taking into account the applicant's FICO score.
For example, if two people have the same FICO score, can the other variables explain
a difference in interest rate between them?

HaskDeep
--------
[HaskDeep](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskdeep "haskdeep on hackagedb")

recursively through a directory structure.
Known hashes are saved to file and they can be used to verify the original files
or a copy of them.

>
> Senigallia cemetery is a monumental cemetery that dates back to the second
> half of the 19th century. It covers the slopes of one of the hills that
> surround the town and walking trough its rows is of visual and historic
> interest. This book is a photographic journey in the old part of the
> Senigallia cemetery, presented through four visual themes: colombarium, gates,
> flowers and plants, decorations. Parallel texts: English and Italian.
