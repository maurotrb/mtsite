{% blockquote Steve Jobs http://www.inc.com/magazine/19890401/5602.html The Entrepreneur Of The Decade, Motivating Employees Article - Inc. Article %}
I think really great products come from melding two points of view — the technology point of view and the customer point of view. You need both. You can’t just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them. By the time you get it built, they’ll want something new.
