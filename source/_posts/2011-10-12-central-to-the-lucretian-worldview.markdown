Central to the Lucretian worldview was the idea that beauty and pleasure were worthwhile pursuits, a notion that permeated every aspect of culture during the Renaissance and has since found its way to everything from design to literature to political strategy â€” a worldview in stark contrast with the culture of religious fear and superstitions pragmatism that braced pre-Renaissance Europe.
