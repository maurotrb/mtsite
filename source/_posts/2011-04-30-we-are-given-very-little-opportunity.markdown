{% blockquote WSJ http://blogs.wsj.com/ideas-market/2011/04/05/the-montessori-mafia/ The Montessori Mafia - Ideas Market %}
We are given very little opportunity, for instance, to perform our own, original experiments, and there is also little or no margin for failure or mistakes. We are judged primarily on getting answers right. There is much less emphasis on developing our creative thinking abilities, our abilities to let our minds run imaginatively and to discover things on our own.
