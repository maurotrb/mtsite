What if you want to learn the way of the analyst, anyway? Remember, a skilled analyst is not an expert in a specific domain (although he tends to grow into an expert in several domains). He’s not the person you pay to get answers. He’s the person you pay to get better questions (and so, indirectly, better answers). The skilled analyst will ask different questions, explore different avenues, and find out different facts. So the essential skills would be observation, knowledge of large class of problems, classification, and description.
